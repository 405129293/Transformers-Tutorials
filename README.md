# Transformers-Tutorials

Hi there!

This repository contains demos I made with the [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) by ðŸ¤— HuggingFace.

Btw, I was also the [main contributor](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/9117) to add the TAPAS algorithm by Google AI to the library, so this was an incredible learning experience. I can recommend anyone to contribute an AI algorithm to the library.
